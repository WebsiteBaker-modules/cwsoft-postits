NOTE:
This module will not work out of the box, as it requires you to add some code to the index.php file of your frontent template.
If you want to display news also in the backend stage of WebsiteBaker, you need to add two core files (for experienced users only).
Detailed information about the changes can be found in the HELP files (DE, EN) located in the /help folder of this module.
The module requires jQuery (v1.7) as distributed with WebsiteBaker 2.8.2 (wb root: /include/jquery/jquery-min.js).

PLEASE NOTE: 
When you have downloaded the module from Github as archived file (zip), you may need to unzip and re-zip the file
before it can be installed via the Website Baker backend (section Add-ons / modules). To pass the Website Baker
installation routine, Add-on files (zip packages) must NOT include the module folder itself, just the module files.
